      <h2>an interactive auditory tool that visually represents the piano's eighty eight keys</h2>
      <p>
        long story short:<br />
        when i hear music, i still see colour.<br /><br />
        short story long:<br />
        before i could speak in full sentences, my mum was already teaching me piano. she stuck little coloured stickers on every key of her old upright yamaha — the one she grew up with in the countrysides of hanoi — and colour-coded every note on every page of music. 
        she turned sound into something i could see, long before i understood what i was hearing. so i guess the piano became my first love.<br />
        like most first loves, life got in the way — and in this case, i <i>let</i> life get in the way.<br />
        i played obsessively for years, then walked away 'for good', only to find my way back again. and again.<br /><br />
        okay i see how this is starting to sound like one of those 'it's complicated' shitty situationships, but i promise it's love. just messy, stubborn, and real.<br /><br />
        it's probably hard to understand, but i hope <i>eighty eight</i> at least makes it a little easier to visualise.
