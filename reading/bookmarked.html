        <h1>things that made me ask questions</h1>
        <h2><i>The Atlantic:</i> Julie Beck's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/10/social-media-relationships-parasocial/684551/" target="_blank">The Great Friendship Flattening</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"Lack of reciprocity is a key part of parasocial relationships-the fan knows a lot about the celebrity while the celebrity has no idea who the fan is. But now a celebrity might respond to your comment on TikTok, or even follow you back. At the same time, reciprocity is a crucial part of real relationships, but for the online component of those relationships, it can be more of a guideline, one that's getting looser as time goes on."</span></p>

        <h2><i>The Atlantic:</i> Spencer Kornhaber's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/arts-criticism-future/684523/" target="_blank">Traditional Criticism Is in Trouble. Here's What's Replacing It.</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"Pondering the things that entertain us—and what those things say about our world—requires a resource that’s in short supply: attention spans."</span></p>

        <h2><i>Big Think:</i> Rachel Berr's <a href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/why-your-best-ideas-come-after-your-worst/" target="_blank">Why your best ideas come after your worst</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"The deleted drafts had achieved their purpose; I could see flickers of thought and 
            phrasing that were clear descendants of their chaos. I realized that I’d been using this rhythm of reckless 
            creation and careful revision throughout my writing life — I just hadn’t put a name to it."</span></p>
        

        <h2>Alec Niedenthal's <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/8363/schandung-desecration-alec-niedenthal" target="_blank">Schändung (Desecration)</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink"></span>"Maybe the longing he felt was the longing one felt for God. To reach toward the divine not for pious 
            reasons but for the solace of not being stranded inside yourself for the rest of your life"</p>

        <h2>Wisława Szymborska's Thank You Note</h2>
        
        <a href="https://wordsfortheyear.com/2018/02/28/thank-you-note-by-wislawa-szymborska/" target="_blank">One translation:</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"The relief as I agree that someone else needs them more."</span></p>
        
        <br><a href="https://poemsthathurt.blogspot.com/2017/10/thank-you-note-wisawa-szymborska.html" target="_blank">Another Translation, by Joanna Trzeciak</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"I understand<br>
        what love never could.<br>
        I forgive<br>
        what love never would."

        <h2>ThePPaper Substack's <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-177611688" target="_blank">The Heat of the Whole Sun</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"I ask how you can be every color I cannot name. I think about what the base of your Russian doll must have been for you to glimmer like this. About the Venn diagram of us, and where your thought knots take you. I wonder if you know how much I love every one you’ve shown me. I mean, I’ve told you I like your brain, right?"</span></p>

        <h2>Sylvia Plath's <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/8498111-Maenad-by-Sylvia-Plath" target="_blank">Maenad</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"The lids won't shut. Time<br>
            Unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun<br>
            Its endless glitter.<br>
            I must swallow it all."</span></p>
            
        <h2>Mac Miller's Certified Annotation on his song, <a href="https://genius.com/10428568" target="_blank">Dang!</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"A lot of the beauty in this record is like lost love and his emotion on there is something very different to him, but it emotes and comes through, and it’s beautiful. I took it a different way."</span></p>
    
        <h2>Wisława Szymborska's <a href="https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/poems/over-wine" target="_blank">Over Wine</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"Only I'm imaginary,<br>
        make-believe beyond belief,<br>
        so fictitious that it hurts."</span></p>
