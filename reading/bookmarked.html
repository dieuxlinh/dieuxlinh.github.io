        <h1>things that made me ask questions</h1>
        <h2><i>The Atlantic:</i> Julie Beck's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/10/social-media-relationships-parasocial/684551/" target="_blank">The Great Friendship Flattening</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"Lack of reciprocity is a key part of parasocial relationships-the fan knows a lot about the celebrity while the celebrity has no idea who the fan is. But now a celebrity might respond to your comment on TikTok, or even follow you back. At the same time, reciprocity is a crucial part of real relationships, but for the online component of those relationships, it can be more of a guideline, one that's getting looser as time goes on."</span></p>

        <h2><i>The Atlantic:</i> Spencer Kornhaber's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/arts-criticism-future/684523/" target="_blank">Traditional Criticism Is in Trouble. Here's What's Replacing It.</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"Pondering the things that entertain us—and what those things say about our world—requires a resource that’s in short supply: attention spans."</span></p>

        <h2>ThePPaper Substack's <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-177611688" target="_blank">The Heat of the Whole Sun</a></h2>
        <p></a><span class="pink">"I ask how you can be every color I cannot name. I think about what the base of your Russian doll must have been for you to glimmer like this. About the Venn diagram of us, and where your thought knots take you. I wonder if you know how much I love every one you’ve shown me. I mean, I’ve told you I like your brain, right?"</span></p>

        <p></a><span class="pink">"The lids won't shut. Time<br>
            Unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun<br>
            Its endless glitter.<br>
            I must swallow it all."</span></p>
