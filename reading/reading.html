                    One thing about me is I love dedications. Be it on worn out park benches or in italicised fonts on the first few pages. I picked this up on a whim at the H Bookstore on a summer afternoon, and it read: <br> "To my family and the Vietnam I left behind." It stuck with me for a week. <br> I came back for it. I'm so glad I did.</small>

                    In the back corner of a small jazz bar in Hanoi, my friend whom I haven't seen in 3 years whispered "I have something for you -- coffee tomorrow?" Over two mugs of warm Vietnamese egg coffee, she slid handed me her very own copy. <br>Thank you, P. I've loved it so far.</small>

                    I picked up running over the summer. Well, that is if you consider a 12 minute mile running. I spent summer afternoons post-coding exploring routes around Cambridge, stopping at every little free library for a peek inside -- but really it was to take a breather. I found this on evening, and ran home with it. </small>

                    One of the traditions I have just between me, myself, and I is that on every trip to New York, I shall stop by Strand and just get lost in the shelves. This was a find I made this summer. Here's to New York City, little traditions, and using our wings. </small>

                    Given to me in parchment paper wrapping in my dorm's basement before I blew the candles out for my 21st, S told me this is a book that means a lot to her. Just a few pages in, I can already see it meaning a lot to me.</small>

            Very rarely do I find a book I read in one go. <br>
            These are ones that I'm actively (or semi-actively) <br>

            Some other titles that I have bookmarked are: <br>
            <em>Les Fleurs du Mal by Charles Baudelaire</em><br>
            <em>Somebody's Daughter by Ashley C. Ford</em><br>
            <em>Severance by Ling Ma (reread)</em><br>

                <div>
                  <small> Klara and The Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro <br><br>
                    Changed view on life and how to live. After all, who am I? Who am I without the love instilled in me? Who am I without the love I give? Who do I, then, want to be? And, well, if I hadn't known this before, this book made me realise that all I want to be is simply the embodiment of love.</small>

                <div>
                  <small> The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath<br><br>
                    Bitter. Poignant. Raw. Never have I yet to see an author walk the lines of fictional non-fiction so skilfully. Stunningly impeccable, and powerfully touching, I'm so glad I exist at the same time as this.</small>

                <div>
                  <small> The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br><br>
                    One of the most nuanced reads, breaking down life, death, and catastrophe in all of its complexity. This book is not just about death; it's about death, and so much else. It's not about calamity; it's about calamity, and so much more. What this book is, is a masterpiece -- a should-be mandatory read, one worthy of a permanent spot on any bookshelf.</small>

                <div>
                  <small> The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley<br><br>
                    "If you ever fall in love, youâ€™ll be a person who was in love for the rest of your life," encapsulates this beautifully. It's a powerful reminder that love, once experienced, becomes an integral part of who we are, influencing our actions and decisions long after the initial feeling has faded.</small>

                  <small> The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov, Mikhail<br><br>
                    A drunk English major neighbour of some friends recommended this to me one night. I thought it was the alcohol talking; it may very well have been that, but the book really is good, too.</small>
