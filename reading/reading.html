                  After not getting over Normal People for two or even three years now, I decided it was great to put myself through the wringer again and caved when I saw a paperback copy at Daunt Books while in London. I finished this within the trainrides across the UK (how the book is meant to be read, in my opinion). Rooney does it again.   </small>

                    With the concept of tethering the lines of life and death very close to my heart and head these days, I'm finding that I have to put this book down a lot because it makes me think. And at the same time, it's such a privilege to be able to read something that makes me feel so much. </small>

                    Given to me in parchment paper wrapping in my dorm's basement before I blew the candles out for my 21st, S told me this is a book that means a lot to her. Just a few pages in, I can already see it meaning a lot to me.</small>

                  <small> Klara and The Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro <br><br>
                    Changed view on life and how to live. After all, who am I? Who am I without the love instilled in me? Who am I without the love I give? Who do I, then, want to be? And, well, if I hadn't known this before, this book made me realise that all I want to be is simply the embodiment of love.</small>

                  <small> The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath<br><br>
                    Bitter. Poignant. Raw. Never have I yet to see an author walk the lines of fictional non-fiction so skilfully. Stunningly impeccable, and powerfully touching, I'm so glad I exist at the same time as this.</small>

                  <small> The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br><br>
                    One of the most nuanced reads, breaking down life, death, and catastrophe in all of its complexity. This book is not just about death; it's about death, and so much else. It's not about calamity; it's about calamity, and so much more. What this book is, is a masterpiece -- a should-be mandatory read, one worthy of a permanent spot on any bookshelf.</small>

                  <small> The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley<br><br>
                    "If you ever fall in love, you’ll be a person who was in love for the rest of your life," encapsulates this beautifully. It's a powerful reminder that love, once experienced, becomes an integral part of who we are, influencing our actions and decisions long after the initial feeling has faded.</small>
