        <h2>overview</h2>
        <p>
            This site is my little corner of the internet — hand-coded and handcrafted, pixel by pixel. No templates, no drag-and-drop builders, just raw HTML, custom CSS, and a dash of JavaScript magic. It’s a reflection of me as a coder, designer, and human who occasionally reads books and watch too much How I Met Your Mother.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s easy to build something fast. It’s harder to build something that feels genuine. This website was born out of that challenge — to create a space that doesn’t just show what I’ve done in CS, but who I am beyond the Git commits.

        <p>
            Here’s a peek into the nooks and crannies of this site of mine:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="../abroad/study-abroad.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study Abroad:</a></strong> An interactive map & highlights from my semester in Paris (mostly spent travelling). I'm well aware I've become one of those annoying people who never shut up about their semester abroad. </li>
        
            <li><strong><a href="../reading/reading.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reading:</a></strong> A visual bookshelf of books I’ve loved, dog-eared, and occasionally sobbed over. Interactive, scrollable, and coded to feel like flipping through a stack of stories. I promise have hobbies beyond pushing code to GitHub.</li>
            
            <li><strong><a href="../thinking/decks.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Card Game:</a></strong> An interactive exploration of love, built as a game where you literally spread cards around as you would in real life. It’s reflective, a little playful, and proof that I don't just think in 1s and 0s.</li>
            
            <li><strong><a href="../art/capture-it.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photos:</a></strong> A gallery of 35mm film shots, some developed by yours truly. These are snapshots of places, people, and feelings — physical evidence that I can put the work away and go touch grass.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each of these pages was designed from the ground up — responsive layouts, custom styles, and intentional interactions.

        <h2>why</h2>
        <p>
            Anyone can spin up a site these days — but I wanted to make one. From scratch. With the usual bugs and the occasional existential crisis (which, by the way, if you spot any bugs... please <a href="mailto:dieuxlinh@gmail.com">let me know</a>... pretty please.) This isn’t just a portfolio; it’s a reminder that coding is creative.</p>
        <p>
            Code or prose, divs or dialogue — I see it all as storytelling. It’s how I sneak in a little bit of myself: what I notice, what I care about, and why #450303 is the best colour and shade of red to ever exist. 
        </p>

    <section id="pilot">
        <h2>ongoing</h2>
        <p>
            Like any good project, this site is a work in progress. I’m constantly updating it with new projects, ideas, and experiments. (Sometimes even cleaning up CSS I swore I'd fix “tomorrow,” so please excuse any messy Git Commits)
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, feel free to click around — peek into my thoughts, play a game, browse through photos. I hope you find something that feels human in here. If you’ve got a book that will change my life or a travel spot that changed yours — <a href="./about-me/about.html">I'd love to know.</a>
