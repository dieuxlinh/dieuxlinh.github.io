    <p class="inspiration">
        this, besides being a glimpse into my thoughts, is inspired by two of the few constants in my life:<br>
        <a href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/">we're not really strangers</a>, and my friends.<br><br>

        we're not really strangers has made me realise the power of coming curious, and how it often,<br>
        if not always, leads to leaving connected. i aspire to do so in every relationship i harbour<br>
        and hold onto through the years.<br><br>

        a friend once reminded me that for the first part of our lives, we are judged by the questions we can <br>
        answer; for the latter, we are judged by the questions we ask. my friends, besides myself, ask me the<br>
        <a href="vault.html">questions i need to hear to grow</a> â€” even if they're hard, and especially if i don't yet have an answer.<br>
        i hope you all have those friends in your lives, for i'm lucky to have mine.<br>
