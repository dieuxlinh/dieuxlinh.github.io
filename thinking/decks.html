    <p class="inspiration">
        this, besides being a glimpse into my thoughts, is inspired by two of the few constants in my life: 
        we're not really strangers, and J.<br><br>

        we're not really strangers has made me realize the power of coming curious, and how it often, if not always, leads to leaving connected. 
        i aspire to do so in every relationship i harbor through the years.<br><br>

        J once reminded me that for the first part of our lives, we are judged by the questions we can answer; for the latter, we are judged by the questions we ask. 
        J is the one person, besides myself, who asks me questions i need to grow. i hope you all have a J in your lives, for i'm lucky to have mine.
