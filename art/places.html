                <p>I like New York because it’s busy. I love it because, even in the chaos, I’ve found my little corners of calm. Like by the fountain at the Met—usually with a book in one hand and sushi hand rolls from my favorite spot in the other.

                <p>This must’ve been taken on one of my many walks back from Sci, probably right after class or wrapping up a p-set. I can still hear the birds and feel that exact sun on my skin if I close my eyes. It’s a reminder that even when life is nonstop, sometimes all I need to do is pause and breathe.

                <p>Even after six years in Massachusetts for school, I’d never made it out to Martha’s Vineyard—until last summer, when my high school hosted a Boston-based alumni reunion there (Roll Hogs!). I took this on a long walk around the island, admiring the houses before finding myself by the coast. Here’s to little adventures, and falling more and more in love with New England.</div>

                <p>While visiting a high school friend in Copenhagen, I took a spontaneous trip to Malmö—thanks to another friend who recommended I see his hometown. He gave the best recs that day (shoutout L!), and my favorite part was wandering through Kungsparken. It hit me then just how lucky I am to have pieces of friendship scattered all over the world.

                <p> Rome was the first stop on my spring break while I was studying abroad in Paris. I had dreamed of coming here for so long that the entire three days felt almost unreal. Seeing the Colosseum in person—so massive, so timeless—was one of those moments that made me feel small in the best way. What a strange and beautiful thing, to find yourself exactly where you once only imagined being.</div>

                <p> From my last visit to New York, where I was meeting an old friend. I’d been upset—though I can’t even remember why—and found myself wandering until I ended up here. Standing on this bridge, I suddenly remembered: the last time I was here was during our first family trip to the U.S., walking at sunset with my mum. I had completely forgotten that moment until now. There’s a quiet kind of magic in remembering.

                <p> While in Rome, I knew I wanted to visit the Vatican. I happened to be there just as news of Pope Francis’ illness came out, and the air felt heavy with hope. Because it was the Jubilee year, I also had the rare chance to walk through the Holy Door. I’ve never really seen myself as religious, but something about being there—at that time, in that place—felt like more than coincidence.

              <p>Morocco was another stop in my Spring Break itinerary. On our way from Marrakesh to Merzouga, we passed by Imouzzer. There was snow in the mountains—something I hadn’t expected at all. The contrast between the palm-lined valleys and the snow-capped peaks was surreal.

              <p>Another stop before reaching Merzouga was Ait Zineb, where Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey was being filmed. The set was still standing. Part of me wanted to take in the landscape just as it was—set and all—while the Cinema student in me couldn’t help but think of Walter Benjamin’s aura of the original, Baudrillard’s hyperreal, and Bazin’s ontology of the image. I think my professors would be proud. I know I am.</div>
