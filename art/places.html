                <p>Despite having lived in Massachusetts for 6 years now for school, I never ventured out to Martha's Vineyard -- until last summer when my high school organised a Boston-based alumni reunion out there (Roll Hogs!). This was taken on my long walk around the island looking at beautiful houses before I ended up by the coast. Here's to more little adventures, and falling mroe and more in love with New England!

                <p>While visiting a friend from high school in Copenhagen, I decided to venture out to Malmö, based on another friend's recommendation to visit his home. He gave me the best recs that day (shoutout L!), and my favourite park was walking around Kungsparken, pictured here. It was then that I realised how truly lucky I am to have friends everywhere I go.

                <p> Rome was my first stop of my most recent Spring break when I was studying abroad in Paris. I had always wanted to go here so the entire 3-day trip felt beyond surreal. The Colosseum is one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen. How lucky am I to be so small in this world!

                <p> This was from my last visit to New York, seeing an old friend. I was upset about something I can no longer recall and had wandered until I found myself here. At this very moment, I realised that the last time I walked this bridge was way back when my family and I visited the States for the first time, and my Mum and I walked here together at sunset. I had forgotten about this moment completely until this very day. There is certainly magic in remembering.

                <p> While in Rome, I knew I wanted to visit The Vatican. I was there right around when we got news of Pope Francis' illness, and got to see how the atmosphere was filled with hope for his recovery. Being here during the Jubilee year also meant I got to walk through The Holy Door. I have never considered myself to be a religious person, but I think there is something that goes beyond chance and fate that life led me here, then.

              <p>Morocco was another stop in my Spring Break itinerary. On our way from Marrakesh to Merzouga, we passed by Imouzzer. There was snow in the mountains—something I hadn’t expected at all. The contrast between the palm-lined valleys and the snow-capped peaks was surreal.

              <p>Another stop before reaching Marzouga was Ait Zineb. Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey was being produced. The set was still there. A part of me wanted to admire the scenery for what it was, set and all; the Cinema student in me spent more time in thought about Walter Benjamin's discussion of aura of the original, Jean Baudrillard's thoughts about the hyperreal, and André Bazin's ideas of ontology. My professors would be proud, as am I.
