                  Last summer, my lab mates and I took a little day trip down to the Cape as it was A and S's first time here. After a day of strolling the town, getting matching lobster plushies, and frantically eating melting ice cream, we ended up strolling by the pier before dinner. I think of them a lot, and how they were such a highlight to that summer of mine.</div>

However, it is thanks to the latter that I was able to enjoy the former with newly made friends. But seriously, never again. Ever.

Also, don't ask us about my attempt at finding seaglass without being swept away by the currents... we're saving that one for a reunion many years from now when they gain the title of 'Best Aunts' to my future kids.

Perhaps that's why it wasn't all too surprising to find out that he is indeed related to R, whose hello hugs and small talk everytime he saw me when I was first introduced to the frat (and still until today) made me feel more welcomed than he knows. Here's to all the radiant people in my life.

                  Venice was my second weekend trip during study abroad, and my first group trip. I knew no one except for M, here, who lived on my floor. Upon dropping our bags, the first order of business was grabbing a $4 spritz and goodness gracious was it great! A few tipsy games of Jenga and several arancini later it was safe to say that the group and I got along perfectly fine - here's to new friends and adventures.
