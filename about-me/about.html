                        I’m a senior at Wellesley College, born and raised in Vietnam. I am majoring in Computer Science with a strong interest in Cinema and Media Studies.
                    I just spent a semester abroad in Paris diversifying my coursework with Film and Art History classes at the American University in Paris.

                        I'm passionate about educational technology — especially when it comes to introducing children to the world of tech. I'm committed to making technology more inclusive and accessible through thoughtful, user-centered design. My interests lie at the intersection of creativity and computation, where I enjoy building projects that combine technology with mixed media. I’m also eager to explore how social computing can be used alongside AI, data analytics, and research to create meaningful and impactful tools.

                        If I could set aside everything else, I would devote myself to filmmaking. My debut would be a docu-series on the tech divide and its impact on underprivileged youth; the next would be a documentary on the importance of institutional memory through the lens of missing, lost, and stolen works of art.

                        Aside from coding, you can find me developing old film photos, <a href="https://www.tauzetaepsilon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appreciating the arts and music</a>, or trying to play the second movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2.

                        When I’m not doing any of the above, I’m most likely enjoying my chamomile tea with two sugars while I doodle and journal about my day. And I’m most certainly rewatching <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.
