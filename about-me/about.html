                        I’m a recent grad from Wellesley College, born and raised in Vietnam. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science and had a concentration in Cinema and Media Studies.
                    While at Wellesley, I spent time at the American University in Paris for abroad, as well as the Olin College of Engineering and MIT as a cross-registered student, researcher, and teaching assistant.

                        I'm passionate about educational technology and interactive media I think we should all play more, and I'm committed to making technology more inclusive and accessible through thoughtful, user-centered design and creative entry points. 
                        My interests lie at the intersection of creativity and computation, where I enjoy building things that combine technology with mixed media. 
                        I’m also eager to explore how social computing can be used alongside AI, data analytics, and research to create meaningful and impactful tools.

                        If I could set aside everything else, I would devote myself to filmmaking. My debut would be a docu-series on the tech divide and its impact on underprivileged youth; the next would be a documentary on the importance of institutional memory through the lens of missing, lost, and stolen works of art.

                        Aside from coding, you can find me developing old film photos, <a href="https://www.tauzetaepsilon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appreciating the arts and music</a>, 
                        or trying to play the second movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2.

                        When I’m not doing any of the above, I’m most likely enjoying my chamomile tea with two sugars while I doodle and journal about my day. 
                        And I’m most certainly rewatching <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.
