            <p>
                I’m a junior at Wellesley College, based in the Boston area, and I was born and raised in Vietnam. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cinema and Media Studies, with an additional interest in French language and culture.

                I am deeply passionate about educational technology, particularly in teaching children about technology. I’m also dedicated to making technology more accessible and creating intuitive user experiences. My interests extend to projects that blend technology with mixed media, where I enjoy exploring practical technical implementations of creative possibilities. I have a strong desire to leverage my skills in the realm of social computing as well as its intersections with AI, data analytics, and research.

                If I could set aside everything else, I would devote myself to filmmaking. My debut would be a docu-series on the tech divide and its impact on underprivileged youth; the next would be a documentary on the importance of institutional memory through the lens of missing, lost, and stolen works of art.

                But for now, when I’m not in office hours asking why my code refuses to run, you can find me exploring wood trails at a pace of 12 minutes/mile, curating Spotify playlists for every emotion.

                When I’m not doing any of the above, I’m most likely enjoying my chamomile tea with two sugars while I doodle and journal about my day. And I’m most certainly rewatching <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.
