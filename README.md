Welcome to my website — part portfolio, part me on a digital interface.

This site is a living collection of projects I’m allowed to publicly share, along with interactive experiments I’ve built along the way, such as:

# Interactive Travel Map
A dynamic map documenting my time studying abroad and travelling through Europe.
# Bookshelf Flick-Through
A visual and tactile way to browse some of my all-time favorite reads and to-be-reads.
# Reflective Card Game
A personal project that turns introspective questions I’ve wrestled with into a card game — draw a card, and sit with the question.
# ...and more.
What's the fun in telling you all my secrets? I hope you have fun exploring the site.
