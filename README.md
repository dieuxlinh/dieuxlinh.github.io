Welcome to my website — part portfolio, part me on a digital interface.

This site is a living collection of projects I’m allowed to publicly share, along with interactive experiments I’ve built along the way, such as:<br>

[Interactive Travel Map](https://www.dieuxlinh.com/abroad/study-abroad.html): A dynamic map documenting my time studying abroad and travelling through Europe.<br>
[Bookshelf Flick-Through](https://www.dieuxlinh.com/reading/reading.html): A visual and tactile way to browse some of my all-time favorite reads and to-be-reads.<br>
[Reflective Card Game](https://www.dieuxlinh.com/thinking/decks.html):A personal project that turns introspective questions I’ve wrestled with into a card game — draw a card, and sit with the question.<br>
[...and more](https://www.dieuxlinh.com/): What's the fun in telling you all my secrets? I hope you have fun exploring the site.
